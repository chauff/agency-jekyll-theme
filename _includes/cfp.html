                           DIR 2016 aims to serve as an international platform (with a special focus on the Netherlands 
                           and Belgium) for exchange and discussions on research &amp; applications in the field of information 
                           retrieval as well as related fields. We invite quality research contributions addressing 
                           relevant challenges. Contributions may range from theoretical work to descriptions of applied 
                           research and real-world systems. We especially encourage doctoral students to present their 
                           research.
