                        DIR is an annual event which is attended by approx. 100 researchers and
                        practitioners, among them many of the top PhD students in the IR field 
                        from the Netherlands and Belgium. It offers a number of sponsorship options, 
                        which allow organizations
                        to gain visibility in the community and contribute 
                        to the success of the workshop. DIR is an ideal place to advertise an
                        organisation's involvement in the field of IR and reach students for
                        potential employment opportunities.
